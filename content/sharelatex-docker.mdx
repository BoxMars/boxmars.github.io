Thanks to the limited computing time of Overleaf, and its often shutdown, I decided to build my own Overleaf using the [ShareLatex](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf) docker image which is a open-source version of Overleaf published by Overleaf.

***Attention**: I only test this guide on Ubuntu and WLS 2 and not sure if it works on other systems.*

## Prerequisites: Docker and Docker Compose

I assume you have installed Docker and Docker Compose on your system. You can refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) for installation instructions.

Btw, if you are in China, you may need to set up a proxy for Docker to pull images from Docker Hub or change the source to a mirror.

## Overleaf Toolkit

Overleaf provides a toolkit to set up your own Overleaf instance. We can find the toolkit in the [Overleaf Toolkit GitHub repository](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit). It contains various scripts and configurations to help us set up Overleaf instance easily.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit
```

If `git` is not installed on the system, you can download the repository as a ZIP file from the GitHub page and extract it.

## Install ShareLatex

```bash
cd toolkit
./bin/init
```

The `init` script will create `overleaf.rc`ï¼Œ`variables.env` and `version` files in `config` directory.

Now, we can start the ShareLatex instance.

```bash
sudo ./bin/up
```

After the stuff above appears, we can open browser and visit `http://localhost/launchpad` to access Overleaf instance.

***Attention**: If you change `OVERLEAF_SITE_URL` in `config/variables.env`, you may need to access the launchpad page via `{OVERLEAF_SITE_URL}/launchpad`*

It time to set up the admin account and login.

*If you set up your email server in `config/variables.env`, you can now send the test mail to check if it works.*

**You have successfully set up your Overleaf instance!**

## Update ShareLatex 

### Update by installing in container

***Attention**: Updating the container may cost a lot of time, depends on your network speed and system performance. If you do not want to wait, you can try to update the container image instead in next section.*

Use `./bin/shell` to enter the container shell:
```bash
./bin/shell
```

Then, run the following command to update ShareLatex:
```bash
tlmgr install scheme-full
```

If `tlmgr` version is too old, you may need to update it first:
```bash
tlmgr update --self
```

If you face the issue that `...Cross release updates are only supported with update-tlmgr-latest(.sh/.exe) --update...`, you can try to run the following command:
```bash
wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh
sh update-tlmgr-latest.sh -- --upgrade
tlmgr update --self
```

If their are some packages that cannot be updated, you can try to run the following command:
```bash
tlmgr update --all
```

After the update is complete, save the container as new image:
```bash
docker commit sharelatex sharelatex/sharelatex:with-texlive-full
```

Then, update `config/overleaf.rc` to use the new image to make sure the new image is used when you restart the container.:
```bash
# Uncomment the following line in config/overleaf.rc
OVERLEAF_DOCKER_IMAGE=sharelatex/sharelatex:with-texlive-full
```

## Change the hostname and port

If you want to change the hostname and port of your Overleaf instance, you can modify the `OVERLEAF_SITE_URL` in `config/overleaf.rc` file. For example, if you want to change the hostname to `overleaf.example.com` and port to `8080`, you can set it as follows:

In the `config/overleaf.rc` file, find the following line:
```bash
OVERLEAF_PORT=8080
```
In the `variables.env` file, find the following line:
```bash
# Uncomment the following line
OVERLEAF_SITE_URL=http://overleaf.example.com
```
